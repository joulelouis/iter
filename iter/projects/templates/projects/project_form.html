<!-- 'method="POST"' is the recommended method for forms that modify data on the server because it ensures that sensitive information (like form data) is sent in the request body rather that in the URL which is more secure -->

    <!-- this template tag generates and inserts a hidden input field into the HTML form. This hidden input field contains a unique token generated by Django. The CSRF token is crucial for protecting your application from CSRF attacks -->
    {% csrf_token %}
