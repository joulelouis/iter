<h1>Project Form</h1>

<!-- 'method="POST"' is the recommended method for forms that modify data on the server because it ensures that sensitive information (like form data) is sent in the request body rather that in the URL which is more secure -->
<!-- 'enctype="multipart/form-data"' is an HTML attribute that allows you to submit the data in the form. This encoding thype is used when you want to include binary data(.exe files, image files, audio files, video files, database files), such as file uploads in the form data -->
<form action="" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <!-- this template tag generates and inserts a hidden input field into the HTML form. This hidden input field contains a unique token generated by Django. The CSRF token is crucial for protecting your application from CSRF attacks -->
    {% csrf_token %}
    <!-- by default, {{form}} will output all the fields from the ProjectForm -->
    {{form.as_p}}
    <input type="submit">

</form>
