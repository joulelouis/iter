What is creating instance?

In programming, creating an instance refers to the process of creating an object base on a class. An instance, also known as an object, is a concrete representation of a class, and it can have its own unique data and state while inheriting behavior and attributes from the class

1. Class
- a class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. It specifies the attributes(data) and methods(functions) that objects of that class will have.

2. Instance
- an instance is an individual object created based on a class. It has its own memory space and can hold its own data. However, it inherits the attributes and methods defined in the class.

3. Constructor
- in many object-oriented-programming languages like Python, when you create an instance of a class, a special method called a constructor is called. The constructor typically initializes the instance's attributes and performs any necessary setup.

Here's an example in Python
# create a Dog class
class Dog:
    # create attributes using the '__init__' method constructor
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
	self.age = age

    # create method
    def bark(self):
	print(f"{self.name} barks!")

# Creating instances of the Dog class
dog1 = Dog("Brownie", 3)
dog2 = Dog("Max", 5)

# Accessing instance attributes and methods
print(dog1.name)	# Output: Buddy
print(dog2.age)		# Output: 5		
dog1.bark()		# Output: Buddy barks!
